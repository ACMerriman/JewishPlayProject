		<h1>About the Jewish Play Project</h1>
		<hr>
		
		<h2>About the "Play Industries" We Look At</h2>
		
		<p>In general toys and games, pinball and videogames are primarily thought of separately. Pinball was born to the coin-op and arcade industries, the same market segment that also includes vending machines and jukeboxes. The business models and channels are very different and members of the Toy and Game industries generally don't include them as part of their own industry. Video Games are more of an overlapping channel to toys and games, but are primarily looked at as another world as well. The Strong National Museum of Play, and I as a visiting scholar there, tend to look at them together.</p>

		<p>In the 1800s, Germany led the world in the production of toys, particularly the state of Bavaria and the city of Nuremberg. Already a hub of industry centered around clockmaking, the industrial capacity was there to support a growth in toys. At the time many toys were made of cast-iron or plated tin. While smaller companies were emerging in Europe, the U.S. and Asia, Germany led the way until the early 1900s when the World Wars reduced the ability of German companies to manufacture and also to sell, due to embargoes against their products. So between the wars and after, the industry in other countries began to grow. Post World War II, Japan became a leading manufacturer but toys and games from the U.S. began to capture the imagination and dollars of consumers both in the U.S. and abroad. As a number of the leading toy and game companies were Aryanized during the rise of Germany's National Socialist Party, many Jewish designers, entrepreneurs and inventors left for Europe or the U.S. to start anew.</p>

		<p>Starting in the Baby Boom years, a combination of factors led to the large U.S. industry. Returning G.I.s with new technical skills, the availability of military surplus tech, the emergence of the third-party toy and game designer and the refinement of plastic to a viable material for toys and games all contributed to the growth. </p>
		
		<p>In the same way that Nuremberg was a center for toy and game companies due to the manufacturing resources of the town, Chicago was the home for many of the largest and most influential pinball companies, an industry born and bred there. The coin operated game as we know it began to surface in 1930 with Gottlieb's Baffle Ball and the Pinball went through ups and down during World War II (due to material and manufacturing shortages) and came roaring back afterwards, only to lose its market in the end to the digital upstarts, the video game cabinets. Today only one major pinball manufacturer, Stern, remains.  The game itself has begun to see a rise in interest in the last decade as nostalgia themed parlors, bars and restaurants have begun appearing in cities around the country. </p>

		<p>The home and portable video game consoles, and most recently, mobile "smart phones" and tablets have all eaten into the markets for toys, dolls and tabletop games; though there's been a significant revival of interest in board games in the past 10-15 years as new styles and types of board game design have emerged from Europe and taken hold by designers, manufacturers and players world-wide.

		<h2>How The Jewish Play Project Got Started</h2>
		
		<p>In the fall of 2012, Professor Stephen Jacobs and Rabbi Robert Morais began discussing the potential for an exhibit on Judaism, play, toys and games for the JCC of Metro Detroit's Shalom Street Museum. That discussion led to Shalom Street's pioneering exhibition, "Across the Board: From Dreidel to XBOX: The Toys and Games of the Jewish People".</p>
		
		<p>During Professor Jacobs' research for the "Toymakers Hall of Fame" section of the exhibition in the summer of 2014, it became clear that there was a much larger story to tell than the exhibit itself could support. So the idea for the Jewish Play Project was born. The Jewish Play Project is supported by the Center for Media, Art, Games, Interaction and Creativity (MAGIC) at the Rochester Institute of Technology.</p>

		<h2>Why It's Online Now Even Though It's Not "Finished"</h2>
		<p>First, this topic covers hundreds of people and companies and potentially thousands of toys since the 1800s. There's opportunity here for decades worth of collaborative scholarly work across numerous institutions. It will be a long time before these efforts are "finished."</p>
		
		<p>Second, we believe in Open Source and Free Content (RIT has the first academic minor in the topic) The philosophy of those communities is to get work out into the community as soon as possible to encourage collaboration.</p>
		
		<p>Third, many of our initial discoveries, and this current web site, would not be possible without the World Wide Web; a technology created to encourage dissemination of pre-publication work to encourage knowledge sharing. It seems only right to make this information public as early as possible.</p>
