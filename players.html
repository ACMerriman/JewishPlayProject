		<h1>Selected and Preliminary List of Designers, Entrepreneurs and Inventors</h1>
		<p>The following list is extensive but by no means comprehensive. It currently covers a period from 1800 to the present, and primarily European and US companies. There are many others who have been post-founding presidents or corporate officers, many of whom made key contributions, that are currently not listed. In some cases the people named served multiple roles in the industry throughout their careers, and could have been listed under more than one heading. Many of them have more toys and/or games beyond those listed here. As this resource grows in the breadth and depth of its content and its technical sophistication, weâ€™ll be able to do greater justice to more people and their achievements.
        <br>All that said, this should serve as an initial indicator of the impact Jewish designers, entrepreneurs and inventors have had on the play industries since the 1800's.</p>
