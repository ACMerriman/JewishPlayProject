        Originaly a manufacturer of "tableware" in tin and pewter, the company began toy production in 1880 or 1890 according to different sources. They made a variety of toys and industrial metal goods, becoming the largest toy company in the world.  US tariffs against foriegn imported toys and the depression of 1929 helped bring the company down in 1932. The company was acquired and refloated as Bing Power Systems. A group of business men has recently revived the name as Gebruder Bing Toys and Bears in Bamberg.<br/>
