		<h3>New Version of the Jewish Play Project Website shown at the Annual Association for Jewish Studies Conference</h3>
		<h4>December 19th, 2016</h4>
		
		<p>A new version of the Jewish Play Project site was one of seven projects highlighted in the Digital Humanities Workshop from 10:00am - 11:30am during the 48th annual conference of the organization. "The conference is one of the leading ones in the field, and very selective," said Professor Stephen Jacobs, Professor in the School of Interactive Games and Media at RIT, "it's a big honor to be included since I'm not a Jewish Studies or History professor."</p>

		<p>The new site, as previewed at the conference, has been extended beyond the original timeline functionality and will allow database searching of the information and eventual contributions by authorized scholars. The site's information has been extended since it was first brought online in 2014 with the help of student researcher Alia Calkins. Students Juliann Internicola and Andrew Merriman were key to the upgrade of the original site.</p>


		<p>After getting feedback from the AJS attendees the new site is planned to be live online by March 1st, 2017.</p>
